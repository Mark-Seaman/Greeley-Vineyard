Greeley Vineyard Technology - tools and process for online church

## About this website

Coordinating the technology for an online church requires a great deal of communication. 
Traditionally this type of communication required face-to-face meetings to discuss outstanding issues.

This is not at all practical in the modern world.  Everyone working on a project must be able to see
what everyone else it working on.

This website provides a focal point for all activities that are related to the use of technology
within the Greeley Vineyard.

## Pay as you go

This site will start small and simple but grow as we learn.  Each time a new skill is discovered it
will be documented here so that anyone can repeat the steps to get the same results.

We will use the "Crawl, Walk, Run" motto to provide guidance for how fast to build our skills.  We will
resist the desire to do something glorious until after we have created the most basic solution to any
problem.

The documentation for a "Crawl" level solution should be no more than a paragraph of text explaining a
new skill. This will be replaced with a page of text and eventually several pages if needed.

## Website Security

This site is intended for everyone that is working on the technology at the Greeley Vineyard.  It is 
readable by the Public.  But only authorized people will be able to edit the content.

If you want to edit then contact Mark Seaman (mark.b.seaman@gmail.com) for access. To make basic edits
you do not need to set up any software on your computer.  For more intensive editing there are ways to
make your work more productive but wait until you have a need for that.
